        <h1>Good and Bad Design Principles</h1>
		
		<h2>Affordance</h2>
			
			<p>Good: Detroitnews.com
				<ul>
					<li>It is very easy to tell what is clickable and what isn’t. Most of the buttons have a rollover effect, whether it is a drop or fill shadow. I know exactly what is going to happen when I click something.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Bad: Hitfix.com
				<ul>
					<li>The scrolling images on the homepage aren’t very intuitive. It looks static until you roll over the image, and it isn’t until then that you realize you  can click arrows to navigate through the images.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
		<h2>Mapping</h2>
		
			<p>Good: Google Earth
				<ul>
					<li>The drag feature works extremely well. I know that when I click and pull the layout to the left, it will start scrolling toward the right, which is perfectly intuitive and works exactly the way it should.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Bad: d2l.msu.edu
				<ul>
					<li>There are multiple buttons that perform the same function. The “content” and “course home” tabs both contain the exact same content, just presented differently. This is unnecessary and should be consolidated. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
		<h2>Chunking</h2>
		
			<p>Good: Hitfix.com
				<ul>
					<li>All of the information is grouped logically. It is sectioned off into Movies, TV, Music, etc.  This makes all the information easy to be and scanned. It is easily digestible.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Bad: Weather.com
				<ul>
					<li>This site feels very saturated with content. Similar content is chunked together, but these big sections of content are not grouped in a way that makes sense. For example, it displays the current forecast, then their favorite stories, then a weather map. Most of the stories aren’t weather related, which is also illogical.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
		<h2>Signal to Noise</h2>
		
			<p>Good: IMDB.com
				<ul>
					<li>There is a single banner ad at the top of the home page that isn’t very big. The rest of the site is all IMDB content. The ad is always TV or movie related, so it fits in and you barely even notice it.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Bad: ESPN.com
				<ul>
					<li>The home page is saturated with ads, which makes the page run slow on my computer. Often times there are huge banner ads that drop down over the page and you have to close them before you can look at anything. And every single video contains at least a 15 second commercial. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
		<h2>Usability (Hick's Law)</h2>
		
			<p>Good: Freep.com
				<ul>
					<li>The site has a very simple organization pattern, so it is very easy to make decisions quickly. If you want to read about sports, you literally have to click one button and it will take you straight to the sports page. It’s fast and efficient.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			
			<p>Bad: ESPN.com
				<ul>
					<li>The menus contain so much content and so many different links to the point that it is distracting. Often times I forget what I went to the site for in the first place. The site should use a more simplistic approach and not inundate their users with so many different options.</li>
				</ul>
